Text = "Observations: \nA significant majority of Pyber's drivers, rides, and fares come from urban areas \nbut the smaller numbers of suburban and rural drivers and generate more income per trip than city\ndrivers, probably due to longer trips or becuase Pyber varies prices based on the demand for \ndrivers at a given time. \n\nUrban drivers make up 80.9% of all drivers but only 68.4%\nof rides and 62.7% of fares, depending on how this data was collected, it is likely that\nbecause urban drivers are earning less per trip that the number of drivers who register to drive \nand then do not continue driving for Pyber is larger in major metropolitan areas.\n\nIt would appear that Pyber, in order to grow their business should seek to increase their reach into rural communities due to the significantly greater return per driver and per trip but without \nknowing how they set prices it could be the case that they would see diminishing returns as more \ndrivers reduce the instances or severity of 'surge pricing' and other mechanisims by which they \nmay increase prices when there are few drivers in an area."
